        <h2>Playing Hockey</h2>
        <img class="about-hockey" src="c:\Users\colby\OneDrive\Pictures\Camera Roll\2024\03\20240305_143157750_iOS.jpg" alt="Hockey" />
        <p>
          I started my hockey career around the same time I started walking. I fell in 
          love with the game through my dad, who played his whole life and was able to 
          represent Team USA on the International stage!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been lucky enough to get the chance to represent Team USA in 
          both the Sub-20 & Men's World Championships. I have captained the Team 
          USA Sub-20 team twice before in our tournaments in Nanjing, China and Barcelona, Spain. 
          In the last 2 years, the U.S. has placed 1st in the 2022 Challenger's Cup in San Juan, Argentina,
          and just recently placed 3rd in the 2024 Pan American Championships making history for this country!
          I will be forever grateful for this sport that has taken me to numerous continents, countries, and cities all over the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          With this sport's main population being located in Europe, my coding adventure started 
          with the hopes that I can get a job with the ability to work remote so I will be able to 
          live anywhere in the world and play hockey!

        <h2>Exercising</h2>
        <img class="about-exercising" src="https://thephysiocompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sport-at-home.jpg" alt="Exercising" />
        <p>
          In order to compete at the highest level for hockey, physical fitness is a huge priority!
          In between all of the on-rink practices, athletes are encouraged to get in the gym
          and work on strength and conditioning. I am not the strongest guy in the world by any means,
          but it is important to keep your muscles toned and disciplined to maintain a good, healthy,
          competitive body for hockey!
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my favorite exercises is running. For some odd reason, I enjoy placing headphones
            in my ears, turning on a good podcast or some good tunes, and just running to clear my mind.
            There is no better feeling than running outside on a nice day, getting some much needed fresh air,
            and enjoying life!

        <h2>Enjoying a Beer With Friends</h2>
        <img class="about-beer" src="c:\Users\colby\OneDrive\Pictures\Camera Roll\2024\02\20240220_085249894_iOS.jpg" alt="Beer" />
        <p>
          While work, school, and hockey are a huge part of my life, it is always
          good to kick back with a few of my best friends and enjoy a beer! Sometimes,
          the serotonin your body gets from socializing, cracking some jokes, and drinking
          a beer can really make your day!
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it is in the backyard around a nice bonfire, in a barstool at your favorite
          place, or in front of the tv watching your favorite sports team, there is no better
          feeling than drinking a beer and sharing some laughs with the most
          important people in your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drinking in moderation is extremely important.
